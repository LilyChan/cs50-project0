This personal webpage project about me(project0) contains four different pages and a fixed navigation bar at the top:

* index.htm  
    This page is like a resume which brifely describes myself and provides education/work list and my contact detail. 
    
* portfolio.html     
    This page was designed to display my previous work results/achivments using tables. Here I just provide 2 episodes: one is my master's thesis, the other one is the course project I did when I studied as an exchange student in Australia.
    
* dance.html  
    Since dance is one of my favorite hobbies in my spare time, here I showcase 2 practice videos of the Hip-Hop class I attend.
    
* cources.html    
   I enjoy learning and improving my skills a lot, especially learnign things online. It is the cheapest and most convenient way for self-growing. Therefore, I list some courses from Udemy that I've already enrolled and plan to take in the near future.
   
* default.css  
  This css file is compiled from default.scss and contains all the styles other than Bootstrap and media queries used in this project.
